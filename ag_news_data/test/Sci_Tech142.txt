ASCAP Shakes Down Burning Man for Music Royalties LOS ANGELES, CA -- Officials from ASCAP today indicated they intend to pursue music royalties from the organizers of Burning Man, an artist's gathering and celebration held over the Labor Day holiday near Reno, NV.   The unconventional event, held annually since 1986, has never paid fees for any of the music played at the event, says ASCAP.  "We intend to pursue all available avenues to get this issue resolved," said Tony Wilcox, ASCAP spokesperson.
