A Fair Tax Some say a "fair tax" that removes the need to file tax returns from the vast majority of the citizenry is a national sales tax.  This doesn't seem to be very fair to people trying to feed, house and clothe themselves and seems to subsidize large land holders (Bush's favorite constituency).  There is a tax that lives up to the promises broken by Bush's proposal for a national sales tax.
