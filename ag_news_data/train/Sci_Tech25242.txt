Keeping Up with iPod  #147;I just received my sixth, an iPod photo, and if I loved my iPod before, I really love it now, #148; writes Bob LeVitus for the Houston Chronicle.  #147;The new iPod photo stores not only your songs, but also your digital pictures. The 2-inch color display is the best little color display I #146;ve seen, and I #146;ve heard many remarks about its clarity and rich, saturated images. Photos look amazing, and iPod photo stores and displays album art for songs which have cover art available. #148; Nov 23
