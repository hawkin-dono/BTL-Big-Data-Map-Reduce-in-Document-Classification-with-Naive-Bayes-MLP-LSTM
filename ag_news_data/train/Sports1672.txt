THECHAT &lt;em&gt; Dean Cain has spent much of his life in a uniform. He's done time as an all-American safety at Princeton (where he established a since-broken single-season Division I-AA record for interceptions), an undrafted free agent with the Buffalo Bills (before a preseason knee injury ended his football career), a sportsman of the future (in the aptly named movie "Futuresport") and an iconic superhero (in television's "Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"). Next up is a set of pinstripes -- Cain plays star third baseman Conrad Dean in the CBS drama "Clubhouse," which is scheduled to debut next month. &lt;/em&gt;
