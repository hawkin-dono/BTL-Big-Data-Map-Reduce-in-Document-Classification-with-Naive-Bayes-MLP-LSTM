NTP in Debian \\The Network Time Daemon (NTP  Daemon) implementation within Debian leaves a\lot to be desired.\\First off they don't include it with a working config.  You have to create your\own /etc/ntpd.conf.  To make matters worse the configuration doesn't accept DNS\names so you have to manually enter IPs.  Fun.  I can understand that they might\not want to provide ONE configuration and overwhelm one or two NTP servers but\they can provide a dynamic config that balances load among all available\servers.  There is of course the public serves list  but you have to Google\for it.\\All you really need to do here is enter a list of servers:\\server time.nist.gov\\server 192.43.244.18\
