Any Command Line Interface Tricks? \\The other day I was thinking about all the edge-cases within Linux and how there\are hundreds of little commands and tricks.  I these know now but only after\using UNIX for more than 15 years now (has it been that long!).  I wish I would\have known all these tricks when I was just getting started.\\This is similar to Danny O'Briens Life Hacks  but since so many of us spend\our life tied to our shell these are essentially "Shell Hacks".\
