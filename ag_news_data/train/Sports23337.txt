SuperSonics Top Nets 79-68 in Ugly Game (AP) AP - A night of ugly basketball failed to blemish the Seattle SuperSonics' surprisingly good-looking record. Despite starting the first half 0-for-10 and the second half 0-for-8, the Sonics got some timely offense from Rashard Lewis and improved the NBA's best record to 8-1 Wednesday night with a 79-68 victory over the New Jersey Nets.
