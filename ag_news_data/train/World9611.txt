Haiti Flood Death Toll Could Reach 2,000 (AP) AP - Workers used dump trucks to empty more than 100 bodies into a 14-foot-deep hole on Wednesday  #151; the first mass grave for the more than 1,070 flood victims of Tropical Storm Jeanne. Bystanders shrieked, held their noses against the stench and demanded that officials collect bodies in waterlogged fields. The government late Wednesday said up to 1,250 people were still missing and that the death toll could rise to 2,000 people.
