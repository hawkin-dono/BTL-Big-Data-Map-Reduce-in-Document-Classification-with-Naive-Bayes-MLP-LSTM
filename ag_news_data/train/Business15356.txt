Zuckerman and Financier to Back Pop Culture Magazine Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the owner of The Daily News, and Jeffrey Epstein, a Wall Street financier, have signed a deal to provide financing for Radar magazine, a celebrity and pop culture magazine that published two test issues in 2003. Maer Roshan, editor in chief, declined to be specific about the level of financial commitment beyond saying it was "significant," but he said it was both a relief and very exciting that the project would now have funding.
