Canada, the Polite Country Prime Minister Paul Martin swore on live television yesterday, apparently frustrated with the progress of a meeting with the provincial ministers over the future of Canada's straining health care system.    During a break in the proceedings, Martin's aunt telephoned him and threatened to   wash his mouth out with soap for using the Lord's name in vain.    When the meeting resumed, Martin apologized to the nation.
