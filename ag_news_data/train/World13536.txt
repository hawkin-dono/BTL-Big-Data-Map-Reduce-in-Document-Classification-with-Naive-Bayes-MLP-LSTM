U.S. Report Finds No Evidence of Iraq WMD (AP) AP - Contradicting the main argument for a war that has cost more than 1,000 American lives, the top U.S. arms inspector said Wednesday he found no evidence that Iraq produced any weapons of mass destruction after 1991. He also concluded that Saddam Hussein's capabilities to develop such weapon had dimmed  #151; not grown  #151; during a dozen years of sanctions before last year's U.S. invasion.
