Dollar Hits Multi-Month Lows Vs Euro, Yen  TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar hit eight-month lows against  the euro and six-month troughs versus the yen on Monday on  continued worries about the U.S. economy and the yawning trade  deficit, and traders say it could fall even further.   Dealers  said the dollar's outlook against the Japanese currency had  worsened because it dropped below the closely watched 107 yen  level -- the lower end of the five-yen range in which it had  moved for the past five months.
