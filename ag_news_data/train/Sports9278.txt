Burks is back for a fond farewell Rarely have the Red Sox made a more ceremonial roster move than the one they made yesterday in activating Ellis Burks from the disabled list. The move gave Burks and Sox fans a chance to bid each other farewell before he retires after the season. Burks, 40, launched his prolific, 17-year career in the majors with the Sox in 1987.
