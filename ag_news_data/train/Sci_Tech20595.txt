The Rumors on the Internets A shadowy group of nerds calling themselves Internets Vets for Truth have collected a pile of video clips related to the current US election. Named after Bush's statement in the second debate, "I hear there are rumors, uh, on the internets," the site includes clips from Going Upriver, Fahrenheit 9/11 (also available for download here), and a number of other odds and ends. If you haven't already been saturated by enough media this year, here's your chance to see the greatest hits.
