Saudis: Bin Laden associate surrenders \\"(CNN) -- A longtime associate of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden surrendered to\Saudi Arabian officials Tuesday, a Saudi Interior Ministry official said."\\"But it is unclear what role, if any, Khaled al-Harbi may have had in any terror\attacks because no public charges have been filed against him."\\"The Saudi government -- in a statement released by its embassy in Washington --\called al-Harbi's surrender "the latest direct result" of its limited, one-month\offer of leniency to terror suspects."\\This is great!  I hope this really starts to pay off.  Creative solutions to\terrorism that don't involve violence.  \\How refreshing! \\Are you paying attention Bush administration?\\
