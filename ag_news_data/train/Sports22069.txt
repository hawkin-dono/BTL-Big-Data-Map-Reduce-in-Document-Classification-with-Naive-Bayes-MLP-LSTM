Tressel Trailed by Allegations Oh, if only the biggest problems in Columbus, Ohio, were how the Buckeyes might get their running game going and beat Purdue today. Not so. In a pair of stories -- one in ESPN the Magazine, the other on ESPN.com -- Ohio State Coach    Jim Tressel  was first accused by former star running back Maurice Clarett of helping him gain access to free cars and of hooking him up with boosters for cash payments. The second story traced such scams back to Tressel's days as the coach at Youngstown State, in Clarett's home town. Ohio State's response to Clarett: He's a liar, and he's lying. Suddenly, though, the Boilermakers aren't Tressel's most daunting opponent.
