The Rundown 15 Arizona State at 1 USC  &lt;em&gt;3:30 p.m., pay-per-view &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you need proof that the Pacific-10 is loaded with quarterbacks, get your eyes on this game, because it may be your best opportunity to see ASU's Andrew Walter, who has the talent and experience to remain poised against USC. After throwing for 428 yards against Iowa, Walter completed just 47.6 percent of his passes and averaged 144 yards in wins over Oregon State and Oregon. Still, compare Walter (249.8 yards per game, 15 touchdown passes, 1 interception) to USC's Matt Leinart (237.4 yards, 10 TDs, 3 INTs). Throw in ASU's excellent pass defense, and the Sun Devils have a chance.
