Pretty Log4J \\I've been a big fan of Log4J  for a while now but haven't migrated any code\over for one central reason.  The following line of code:\\    final static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger( "some.name" );\\... is amazingly ugly and difficult to work with.\\Most people use Log4J with a logger based on the classname:\\So we would probably see:\\    static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger( "org.apache.commons.feedparser.locate.FeedLocator" );\\Which is amazingly verbose.  A lot of developers shorten this to:\\    static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger( FeedLocator.class );\\But this still leaves us with cut and paste errors.\\What if we could just reduce it to:\\    static Logger logger = Logger.g ...\\
