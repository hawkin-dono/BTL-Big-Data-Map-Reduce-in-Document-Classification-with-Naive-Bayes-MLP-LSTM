Banning the Bible to Get Out the Vote There have been some rumors floating around lately about an RNC ad that is being sent to people living in the Bible Belt about how 'liberals' want to "ban the Bible" (what that really means, I don't know, but there you have it).  It ain't a rumor folks, this is U.S. Presidential Campaign 2004, at its finest.
