Dallas Cowboys Stuff Chicago Bears 21-7 (AP) AP - Drew Henson will have to wait before he's the star of the Dallas Cowboys offense. Right now, the youngster turning heads is rookie running back Julius Jones. Jones burst up the middle for a 33-yard touchdown on Dallas' first drive and was still going strong at the end, scoring again from the 4 midway through the fourth quarter to help the Cowboys beat the Chicago Bears 21-7 Thursday.
