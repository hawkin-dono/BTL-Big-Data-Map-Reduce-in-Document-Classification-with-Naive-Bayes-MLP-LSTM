Yankees hold off Blue Jays Derek Jeter, Hideki Matsui, and Bernie Williams each homered and the New York Yankees held on for an 8-7 victory over the Blue Jays last night in Toronto. Esteban Loaiza failed to make it out of the fifth inning in another poor start since being acquired from the Chicago White Sox in a July 31 trade for Jose Contreras.
