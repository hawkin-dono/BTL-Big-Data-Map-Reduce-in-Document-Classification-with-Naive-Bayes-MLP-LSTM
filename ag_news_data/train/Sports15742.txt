Neck Injury Ends Rich Gannon's Season (AP) AP - Rich Gannon will not return to the field for the Oakland Raiders this season because of a broken vertebra in his neck. The quarterback, who turns 39 in December, saw four of the country's top neck and spine specialists over the past couple of weeks and was told he shouldn't try to play again this year. But Gannon didn't rule out a return next season and wasn't ready to say he's going to retire.
