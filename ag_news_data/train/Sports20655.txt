No. 4 California Nicks Oregon 28-27 (AP) AP - California's fate was in Keith Allen's hands, and the Oregon receiver dropped the ball. Geoff McArthur caught eight passes for 121 yards and two touchdowns, and fourth-ranked Cal's defense stopped Oregon near midfield with 1:39 left when Allen couldn't hold the final pass in the Golden Bears' 28-27 victory Saturday that solidified their Bowl Championship Series hopes.
