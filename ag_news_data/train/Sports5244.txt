Dementieva Advances to U.S. Open Semis (AP) AP - With a shot at claiming the No. 1 ranking, Amelie Mauresmo engaged Elena Dementieva in a contest called, "Anything you can do, I can do worse." Mauresmo allowed an aching, ailing and double-faulting Dementieva to come back from a set and a break down to win their miscue-marred U.S. Open quarterfinal 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (1) Tuesday.
