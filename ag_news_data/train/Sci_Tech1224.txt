Subway Sandwiches:  quot;Warum sind die Amis so fett? quot; That would be "Why are the Yanks so fat?" to you and I.    This was the slogan used in Germany for a recent  Subway/Super Size Me joint advertising campaign. Accompanying the advert was a rounded looking image (full size) of the Statue of Liberty carrying burgers and     fries.    Did Subway go too far in this campaign, or were they unfairly vilified for their jest?
