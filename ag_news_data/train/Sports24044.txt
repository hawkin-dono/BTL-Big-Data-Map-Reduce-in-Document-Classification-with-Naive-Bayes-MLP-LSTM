England 32 South Africa 16: Shocking South Africa left trailing by &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt; A wonderful result for what had become, because of injury and retirement, a beleaguered rugby nation. England began in control, they never lost that control and both the squad and their new coaching set-up will take fantastic heart from it all.
