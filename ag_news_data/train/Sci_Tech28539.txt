Hey Ann, Just Try It! On a recent political round table on CNN, Ann Coulter took a swipe at Canadians, saying that we should consider ourselves "lucky that we are allowed to exist on the same continent" as the US.     Alright, Ann, this isn't the first time that an American has denied our right to exist. It's been going on for most of US history. But let's say, for the sake of argument, that we exist at the USA's continued sufferance. If we're that much trouble, why not do what your implications in those statements suggest.    Invade. You're bound to do better than you did before.    Just remember that last time, someone  burned the White House down.
