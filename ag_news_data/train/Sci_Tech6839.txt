Researchers Study Cattle Altitude Sickness (AP) AP - Two University of Wyoming researchers are working on developing a test to diagnose altitude sickness in cattle. Cattle under a year old are especially susceptible to altitude sickness above 5,000 feet. But the condition, called brisket, can only be diagnosed by inserting a probe into the jugular vein and measuring blood pressure in the heart and lung.
