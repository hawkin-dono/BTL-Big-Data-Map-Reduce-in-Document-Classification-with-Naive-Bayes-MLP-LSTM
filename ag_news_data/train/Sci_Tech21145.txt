Microsoft Seeks Change Before Dividend (AP) AP - For Microsoft Corp. shareholders, the holidays will likely come early this year in the form of a one-time  #36;3 dividend that's part of the company's plan to return some of its  #36;64.4 billion cash horde back to shareholders. But Microsoft won't hand out the cash unless shareholders allow the company to alter its stock compensation plans, so employees who hold stock options and stock awards aren't hurt by the dividend payout.
