Eldred not penned in ST. LOUIS -- Over time, Cal Eldred has learned to embrace the bullpen. The righthander came to the St. Louis Cardinals in the spring of 2003 looking to compete for a spot in the rotation. Before undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery, he had been a productive starter for the Brewers, and won 10 games for the White Sox in 2000.
