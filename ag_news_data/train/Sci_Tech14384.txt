Digital vs. analog- which is better? In the movie The Rock, the protagonist is a chemestry nerd who gleefully signs for a package as if he's a kid who's just gotten his box tops honored with a toy in the mail. He opens it- and it is an old, presumably pristine, Beatles LP.    His fellow chemist asks, "why would you pay \$600.00 for that when you can get the CD for thirty?"    "Because," the nerd says, "these sound better."    But do they, really?
