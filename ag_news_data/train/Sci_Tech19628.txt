Study: 100,000 civilian deaths due to Iraq invasion Today, the Lancet medical journal published a report which concludes that 100,000 civilians died in the US-led invasion of Iraq. This is an incredibly high estimate, and at first may seem too farfetched not to be propaganda. But it cannot easily be dismissed. The report's authors are researchers from Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, and Al-Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. The Lancet is a highly-respected, peer-reviewed publication. The report appears to be a serious academic attempt to study the public health consequences of the invasion.  Also, The New Republic magazine has conducted an interview with Prof. Gilbert Burnham, the report's main author.   Excerpts and comments below.
