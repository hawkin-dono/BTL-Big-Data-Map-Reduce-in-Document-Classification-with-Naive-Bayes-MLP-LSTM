In Brief: Nextance launches Intellectual Property Optimization Suite Nextance last week announced its Intellectual Property Optimization Suite, which enables users to manage valuable intellectual property (IP) assets and associated contractual agreements in order to more effectively optimize revenue and mitigate legal risk related to IP. Nextance's IP Optimization Suite manages the entire lifecycle of IP assets and addresses such issues as underutilized IP assets, underpaid licensing and royalty revenue, unnecessary risks related to legal compliance, and sluggish time-to-market for new solutions that increasingly depend on IP. Pricing starts at \$500,000 and ranges to over \$1,000,000 depending on the size of the organization and sophistication of the implementation.
