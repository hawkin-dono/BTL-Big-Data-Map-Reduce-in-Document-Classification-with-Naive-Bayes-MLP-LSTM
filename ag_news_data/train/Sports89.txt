DiMarco, Riley Play Way Into Ryder Cup (AP) AP - Chris DiMarco and Chris Riley faced knee-knocking pressure in the last round of the PGA Championship. And what did they get for their efforts? More of the same. DiMarco and Riley played themselves into the pressure-packed Ryder Cup with their performances Sunday in the year's final major. DiMarco finished second after a three-man, three-hole playoff and Riley was fourth  #151; good enough to knock Jay Haas and Steve Flesch out of the top 10 in the Ryder Cup point standings.
