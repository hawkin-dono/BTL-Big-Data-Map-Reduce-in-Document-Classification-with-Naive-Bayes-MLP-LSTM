Hurricane Center Director Is Calm Force (AP) AP - In the midst of a crisis, Max Mayfield sets his schedule in four-minute increments. That's the amount of time the director of the National Hurricane Center allots each media crew camped out in the bunker-like building where forecasts are drawn up. He sets aside an hour to help assemble regularly scheduled advisories, and pauses to take calls from higher-ups, including U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans.
