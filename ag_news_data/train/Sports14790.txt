Rolen Breaks Out of Slump to Help Cards Win (AP) AP - Scott Rolen is contributing again  #151; and that's bad news for the Houston Astros. The Cardinals twice rallied from a two-run deficit in their 10-7 victory over the Houston Astros in Game 1 of the National League championship series on Wednesday night. Rolen was responsible for tying it the second time, ending a 3-for-32 slump with a line-drive single in the fifth inning.
