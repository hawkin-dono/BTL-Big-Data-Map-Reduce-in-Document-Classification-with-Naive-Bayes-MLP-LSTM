Croissants, Coffee and a Kickoff When the alarm goes off today for the players at Boise State and San Jose State, they'll yawn, stretch and mutter something like, "It must be noon somewhere." Think television is an innocent bystander in college sports? If so, hit the snooze button. The Broncos and Spartans will kick off their Western Athletic Conference tilt at 9:02 a.m. Pacific Time, for the benefit of ESPN2. To adjust, Boise State Coach Dan Hawkins has had the team up at 5 a.m. all week. "We're used to having to play whenever ESPN wants to cover it," Boise State's    Daryn Colledge  told the Idaho Statesman. Ah, the purity of college athletics.
