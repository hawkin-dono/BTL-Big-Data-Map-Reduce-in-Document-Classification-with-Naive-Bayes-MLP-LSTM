Bush Mocks Kerry's Leadership Credentials (AP) AP - President Bush mocked John Kerry's fitness to be commander in chief Wednesday, saying the way to bring U.S. troops home from Iraq "is not to wilt or waver." Kerry suggested to a campaign crowd that Bush might bring back the military draft and said in an Associated Press interview that the president was "living in a make-believe world."
