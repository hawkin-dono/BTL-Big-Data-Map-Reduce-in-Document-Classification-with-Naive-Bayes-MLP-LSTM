The Flow of Interstellar Helium in the Solar System European Space Agency -- 'Consensus on conditions in the cloud of interstellar gas surrounding the Sun from several in-situ observation methods'     Through coordinated observations with instruments on several ESA and NASA spacecraft and a collaborative analysis effort hosted by the International Space Science Institute (ISSI) an international team of scientists has compiled for the first time a consistent set of the physical parameters of helium in the very local interstellar gas cloud the surrounds the solar system.     Careful analysis of data from three complementary observation methods produced a reliable set of physical parameters for the local cloud which can be used to model the interaction between the Sun and the surrounding interstellar gas and establish dimensions of the solar system...
