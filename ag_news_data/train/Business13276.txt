Why cant Johnny compute? When I suggested in a recent column that a problematic 5 percent of employees account for 75 percent of the IT support burden, I expected a wave of right on! letters from IT support staffers. After the column was published, the letters did come  most of them disagreeing with my premise, with one reader suggesting that the real whiner was yours truly. I still think its outside the realm of overextended IT departments to provide training on basic computing skills (which I defined as managing and finding files, and basic working knowledge of suites such as MS Office). But my thinking was adjusted a bit by the thoughtful feedback.
