Surf's up for Hutchinson CHICAGO -- Chad Hutchinson, who was surfing in California a little more than two months ago, made his first Chicago start a memorable one yesterday, throwing three TD passes to lead the Bears past the Minnesota Vikings, 24-14. Minnesota (7-5) saw its playoff chances hurt for the second straight year by a late-season loss to the Bears.
