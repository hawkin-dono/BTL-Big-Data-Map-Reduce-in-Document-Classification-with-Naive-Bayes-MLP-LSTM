Statement of Senator Barbara A. Mikulski on Hubble Report Issued &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;  quot;I commend the National Academy of Sciences on this outstanding report. I fought to add \$300 million to NASA #39;s budget for a Hubble servicing mission and I will continue to advocate for a mission to take place.
