Saints Beat Panthers, but Season Ends (AP) AP - Masters of the late-season flop, the New Orleans Saints finally won a game that mattered. Then they had to wait to see just how much it mattered. Needing to beat the Carolina Panthers to stay in playoff contention, the Saints did their part with a 21-18 victory on Sunday. But they needed outside help to get in, and failed to get it. Halfway across the country, the St. Louis Rams beat the New York Jets 32-29 in overtime, ending the season for the Saints.
