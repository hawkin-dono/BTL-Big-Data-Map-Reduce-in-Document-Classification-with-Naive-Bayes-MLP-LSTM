Moonlight Special (Forbes.com) Forbes.com - It's rare, but sometimes a good manager at an expensive load fund can be found making a little extra money on the side by also running a cheaper, comparable no-load fund. In fund argot, this moonlighting is called "subadvising." Why not go for the cheaper fund where the hotshot manager does extra duty? Especially when the second fund's performance mirrors or even exceeds the star manager's marquee fund.
