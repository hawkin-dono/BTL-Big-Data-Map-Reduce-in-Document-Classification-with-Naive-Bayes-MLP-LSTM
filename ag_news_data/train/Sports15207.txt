Astros' Lidge Ready to Be Called Upon (AP) AP - Brad Lidge is starting to get antsy. The Houston Astros' closer has warmed in the first two games of the NLCS, but has remained in the bullpen. He wasn't needed in Game 5 of the division series, either, so his last appearance was Sunday  #151; when he blew a save against Atlanta.
