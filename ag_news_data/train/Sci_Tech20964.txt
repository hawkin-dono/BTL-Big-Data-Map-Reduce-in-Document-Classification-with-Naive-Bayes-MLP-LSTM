The Failure of the American Experiment A lot of Bush haters are United States citizens.  Many feel they must now leave their country and renounce their citizenship, and feel trapped that they can't.  Many Bush supporters are taking glee in encouraging them to do so, knowing full well many have no options for emigration.  The problem is both "liberals" and "conservatives" have forgotten the United States is about much more than "democracy".  It is about a laboratory of the States within which migration and eminent domain support the pursuit of happiness by providing a mutual defense system for peoples experimenting with their own widely varying belief systems.
