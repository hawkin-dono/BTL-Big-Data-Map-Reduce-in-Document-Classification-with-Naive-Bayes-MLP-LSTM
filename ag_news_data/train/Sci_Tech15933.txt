IBM powers up high-end disk arrays IBM took a major step last week in its plan to remain at the forefront of storage technology by introducing two new disk arrays -- the DS6000 for the upper midrange market and the DS8000 for the high-end market. Both systems are designed for ease-of-use and modular for lower cost. They also feature high-end storage capabilities and virtualization technology, all in systems considerably smaller than previous versions.
