Jon Stewart Attacks the Media through Crossfire Instead of plugging his new book, Jon Stewart tonight on CNN's crossfire used his time to slam the media's coverage of the election.  Although Stewart leans left, he attacked political shows and begged them: "Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America."  Is it time to really stop all the political games that both sides play?  Torrent of the event is available.
