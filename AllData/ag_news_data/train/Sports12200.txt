Rams Use Rejuvenated Running Game in Win (AP) AP - For at least one game, the pass-happy St. Louis Rams relied on the running game. A week after coming under heavy criticism for a game plan that featured 49 passes and just 15 runs in a 28-25 overtime loss at home against New Orleans, coach Mike Martz used the run early and often in a 24-14 win Sunday night at San Francisco, evening the Rams' record at 2-2.
