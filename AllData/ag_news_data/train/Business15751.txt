If You Believe (Forbes.com) Forbes.com - Frank L. VanderSloot sells items like Classic Tooth Polish ( #36;3 a tube), Replenex (90 glucosamine pills for  #36;10) and Nicole Miller Timeless Age Defying Serum ( #36;18 a bottle). He doesn't hit the road himself to ring doorbells. At 56, his sales days are far behind him. He leaves the pitching to an army of part-time hucksters who sell these and 350 other household and "health" products for Melaleuca, his privately held firm in Idaho Falls, Idaho.
