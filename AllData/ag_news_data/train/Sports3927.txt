Indians Rout Yankees 22-0 in Epic Defeat (AP) AP - The hits and runs kept coming, spinning by on the scoreboard as fast as symbols on a slot machine. It wasn't just a rout, it was an epic defeat, the most one-sided in the 101-year history of the New York Yankees. Cleveland's 22-0 victory Tuesday night matched the biggest post-1900 shutout margin in the major leagues, Pittsburgh's win at the Chicago Cubs on Sept. 16, 1975.
