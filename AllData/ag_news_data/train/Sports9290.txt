Lester set to go Three plays. That's been the sum total of Larry Lester's contribution to Boston College's 3-0 start. Lester was shelved for the first two games of the season when he partially tore his left posterior cruciate ligament on the first play of BC's first preseason scrimmage. He returned to the field for last week's 27-7 victory over Big East foe Connecticut.
