The Little Website that Couldn't There once was a boy who for no apparent reason went around knifing his classmates. This boy's parents took him to nearly every mental health professional with no success... until one day a famous hypnotist came to town. There was a long line to speak to him, and as they waited medical doctors hovered around them trying to convince them it was all quackery.  But the parents, figuring they had nothing to lose, continued standing in line with their disturbed son.  At long last they told the doctor about their son's twisted history, and after a long pause the doctor looked the boy square in the eye and said,  "My, won't you be surprised when you never do anything like this again."
