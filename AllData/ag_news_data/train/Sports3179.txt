With 98 Medals, U.S. Tops Sydney Total (AP) AP - With the women's 1,600-meter relay team winning gold Saturday night, the United States picked up its 98th medal, topping the total won four years ago in Sydney. Next up: the goal of 100 set by the U.S. Olympic Committee. There was a chance of hitting it late Saturday through one more relay, the men's javelin and men's basketball. If not, it could be tight on Sunday.
