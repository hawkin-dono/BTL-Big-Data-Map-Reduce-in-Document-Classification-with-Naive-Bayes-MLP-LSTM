Is there a future for the 1Gig email services? We all remember April 1st when Google announced its new Gmail web-mail service with an overwhelming 1Gig storage space. Their mere announcement brought a new wave of 1Gig web-mail services such as Walla  , Spymac  and more. Since they don't charge for the service, their plan is to profit from advertisement revenue stream.  It's been 6 month now, and Gmail is still in beta stage and many competitors are joining the scene on an almost daily basis.
