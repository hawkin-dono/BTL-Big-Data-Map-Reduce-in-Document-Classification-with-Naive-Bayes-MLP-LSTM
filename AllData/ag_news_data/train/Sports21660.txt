Surgical precision With time expiring, Paul Pierce hit a fadeaway 21-footer over the outstretched left arm of Ruben Patterson, giving the Celtics a 90-88 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers last night. Pierce jumped on the scorer's table before teammates quickly lifted him back to the safety of the FleetCenter parquet. Given Pierce's condition, it was a jubilant, yet cautious, celebration.
