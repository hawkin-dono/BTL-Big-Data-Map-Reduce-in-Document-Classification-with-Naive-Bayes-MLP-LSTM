No Changes to the Induce Act Please! \\Just let it die!\\The amount of damage this will cause our economy and to the Technology industry\is staggering.\\Let this argument evolve.  The RIAA/MPAA doesn't speak for the entire country.\All this will do is push P2P development offshore.\\"The U.S. Copyright Office has drafted a new version of the Induce Act that it\believes will ban networks like Kazaa and Morpheus while not putting hardware\such as portable hard drives and MP3 players on the wrong side of the law."\\"The original Induce Act has been severely criticized for possibly jeopardizing\products such Apple Computer's iPod that could "induce" people to commit piracy."\\
