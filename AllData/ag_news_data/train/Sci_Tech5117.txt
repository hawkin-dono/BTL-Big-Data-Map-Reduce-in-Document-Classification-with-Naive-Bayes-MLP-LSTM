Context Specific Mirroring \\"Now, its not that I dont want to have this content here. Far from it. Ill\always post everything to somewhere on this site. I just want to treat each\individual posting as a single entity and place it in as fertile a set of beds\as possible. I want context specific mirroring. I want to be able to choose\multiple endpoints for a post, and publish to all of them with a single button\click."\\
