Red Thai Vegetable Curry This week I purchased the ingredients for Red Thai Curry, a fantastic dish I was first introduced to at Bangkok Pavilion in my wonderful home of Kansas City. It has fantastic, varied texture, a medley of rose-tinted colors, and a scent sure to get any curry enthusiast's saliva glands working overtime.  After returning from the grocery store with my bag of goodies, I wasted no time in preparing my meal.  My shopping list included:    1 bag sticky sushi rice  1 can coconut milk  Red Thai curry paste  fresh basil leaves  fresh anise leaves  1 green bell pepper  1 red onion  1 tomato  1 bag frozen peas  lemon grass  Total time from preparation to serving is about 45 minutes, so set aside at least an hour just in case there's an unforeseen complication.
