Kodak Profits on Discontinued Operations  NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eastman Kodak Co. &lt;A HREF="http://www.investor.reuters.com/FullQuote.aspx?ticker=EK.N target=/stocks/quickinfo/fullquote"&gt;EK.N&lt;/A&gt;, the world's  top maker of photographic film, on Wednesday said its third  quarter profit rose, boosted by discontinued operations. Sales  were boosted by the weaker dollar and its key growth area of  digital photography.  Rochester, New York-based Kodak, which one year ago announced a  dramatic strategy shift toward digital cameras and printing and  away from film, posted net income of \$479 million, or \$1.67 a  share, including \$1.51 from discontinued operations. A year  earlier its profit was \$122 million, or 42 cents a share.
