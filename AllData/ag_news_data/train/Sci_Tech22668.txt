UPS reinvents package flow UPS likes to do things big way. Last year, the company garnered a place in the InfoWorld 100 with a wireless project that will ultimately replace 55,000 scanning devices. This year, the company takes the coveted top slot, thanks to a nine-year, \$600 million package flow initiative that as of October 2004 has successfully transformed 250 of the companys 1,500 package centers.
