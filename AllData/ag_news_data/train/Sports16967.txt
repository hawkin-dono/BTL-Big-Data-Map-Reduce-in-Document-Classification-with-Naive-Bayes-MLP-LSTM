The Rundown 4 Miami at N.C. State &lt;em&gt;7:45 p.m., ESPN &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think the Wolfpack is kicking itself for that loss two weeks ago at North Carolina? You bet. Had N.C. State (4-2, 3-1 ACC) won that one, this would be for sole possession of first place in the ACC. As it is, this is a chance for the Wolfpack to show it belongs in the upper echelon of the restructured league -- which, for now, is Miami, Florida State, and a cesspool of also-rans. The Wolfpack's defense is the best in the nation against the pass (97.5 yards per game) and overall (203.7). It will have to shut down a rejuvenated Brock Berlin, who threw for 308 yards last week against Louisville, his most in 13 games. Key for N.C. State: Will perpetually banged-up tailback T.A. McLendon -- a game-time decision because of a bad hamstring -- be able to run effectively?
