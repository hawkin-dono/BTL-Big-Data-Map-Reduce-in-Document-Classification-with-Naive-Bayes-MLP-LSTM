Jones Fails to Win Medal in Long Jump or Relay ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A botched relay handoff doomed Marion Jones' chances of winning even a single medal at the Athens Olympics, a disastrous ending to her summer of turmoil and disappointment. Hoping to win a pair of golds Friday, Jones was shut out instead. An hour after she finished fifth in the long jump, Jones was unable to make the handoff in the 400-meter relay when Lauryn Williams left too early.
