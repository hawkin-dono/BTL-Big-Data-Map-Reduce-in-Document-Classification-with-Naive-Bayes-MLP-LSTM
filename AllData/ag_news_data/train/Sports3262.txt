Dream Team Salvages Bronze, Dignity (AP) AP - Bronze is better than nothing. That's one Olympic lesson the U.S. men's basketball team was able to understand. The Americans took the third-place game seriously Saturday night, earning some revenge and salvaging some self-respect in a 104-96 victory over Lithuania. Although they didn't get what they wanted in Athens, they didn't embarrass themselves in their finale, either.
