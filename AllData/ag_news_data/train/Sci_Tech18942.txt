Wireless Utopia \\In light of the new Treo release  from yesterday I've been thinking a lot\about wireless, bluetooth, and mobile devices.\\Its obvious to many that the future involves persistent connection.  Why would\you ever want to be off the Internet?  I want my cell phone to support IP and\the ability to connect to my laptop.\\Bluetooth gives me this now but VOIP will give it to me in the future.  Why do I\need cell phone with service from Sprint when I can use Skype or SIP?\\Thers no reason I couldn't have both my laptop and cell permanently connected to\the Net.  When my laptop isn't within range of a decent WiFi signal it can\revert to using my cell phone.\\You could then IM me or VOIP me at any time ...\\
