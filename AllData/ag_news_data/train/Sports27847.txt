Correction: Morehead-St-Kentucky Story (AP) AP - In a Dec. 8 story about the Morehead State-Kentucky basketball game, The Associated Press reported erroneously that in a 71-40 loss, Morehead State scored its fewest points in a game since early in the 1978-79 season, when the Eagles had 37 in a loss to Indiana. Morehead State scored 32 points in a 1995 loss to Kentucky.
