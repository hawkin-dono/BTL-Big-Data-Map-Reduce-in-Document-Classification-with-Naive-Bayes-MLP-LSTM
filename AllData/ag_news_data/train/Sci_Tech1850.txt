The Shame of Adult Male Virginity My feeling is that somewhere between the ages of 18 and 22-25 society      starts expecting men to not be virgins. Well, maybe "expecting" is      not the right word, but that's the age range were I started feeling      shame about being a virgin.  There are many advantages to being a virgin: you know you're not diseased, you know you're not a daddy and you don't have a woman who has reached deep into your inner feelings and can manipulate you with that leverage. A quick side note about diseases: besides the scary lifelong and life-threatening sexually transmitted diseases it is estimated that as many as 50 of sexually active singles have Genital Warts, for which there is no cure. They are extremely easy to transfer between partners and can be a precursor to penile, cervical and rectal cancer.
