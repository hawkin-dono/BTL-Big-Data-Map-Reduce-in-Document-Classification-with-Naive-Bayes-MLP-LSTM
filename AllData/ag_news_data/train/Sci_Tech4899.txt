Illegal Research and Patents \\If the US makes Stem Cell research illegal, and a company in a foreign country\(say Japan), develops a cure for a desease (say Cancer, or Alzheimers), can\said company file a patent in the US?\\I assume so... seems like a pretty good reason to make Stem Cell research legal.\\
