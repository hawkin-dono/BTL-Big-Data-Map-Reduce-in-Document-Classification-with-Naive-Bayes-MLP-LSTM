Tough Leftwich Ready for Showdown at Indy (AP) AP - Jacksonville quarterback Byron Leftwich doesn't understand why his teammates and coaches rave about his toughness. Sure, there was the memorable shin injury he played through at Marshall in 2002  #151; when his linemen had to carry him downfield after big gains against Akron. Then there was the bruised shoulder and sprained ankle he played through last weekend against Kansas City.
