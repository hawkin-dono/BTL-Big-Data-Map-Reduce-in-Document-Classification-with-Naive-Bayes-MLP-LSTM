Longhorns Hope to Bypass Holiday Bowl (AP) AP - When Colorado coach Gary Barnett looks at the Texas roster or watches the Longhorns on tape, he comes to a simple conclusion. "They sure have a pretty team," he said. He means pretty, as in big, fast and talented. It's exactly the kind of team they should have at a school as renowned as Texas, which is why it's hard to understand how the Longhorns (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) keep winding up in the Holiday Bowl.
