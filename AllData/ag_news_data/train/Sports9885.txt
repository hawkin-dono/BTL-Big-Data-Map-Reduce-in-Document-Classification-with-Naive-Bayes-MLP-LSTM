St. Mary's takes control In its quest to relive last fall's championship season, St. Mary's defeated Cathedral, 34-14, yesterday to stay unbeaten in the Catholic Central Small at 3-0. The Cathedral defense, which was led by Mackenzie Lane (10 tackles, three quarterback rushes), made an early stand, sending St. Mary's to the sideline after a quick three and out.
