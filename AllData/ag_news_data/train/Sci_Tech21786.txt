Study Shows Golf Courses Good for Birds (AP) AP - A new study shows that golf courses can be good homes for more than one kind of birdie. The study by South Carolina researchers tracked bird mating seasons for two years on 24 golf courses along the Grand Strand. The study found that natural vegetation on the region's courses increases the bird population and variety of birds, as well as drawing other animals.
