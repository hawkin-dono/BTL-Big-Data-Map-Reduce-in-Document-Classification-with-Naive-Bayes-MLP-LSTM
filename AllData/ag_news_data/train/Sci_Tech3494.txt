Does a NY Supreme Court judge say that the Central Park lawn is more important than free speech? Here is the coverage in The New York Times and the New York Law Journal about the denial of United for Peace and Justice's Sunday rally in Central Park (United for Peace and Justice v. Bloomberg, 111893/04), and here is what NY Supreme Court1 Justice Silbermann said:      ... the evidence established that the department's determination was based on entirely content-neutral factors, to wit: that the Great Lawn2 was not an appropriate venue for a demonstration of this magnitude.     ...  The Parks Department appropriately applied content-neutral regulations while leaving plaintiff with a reasonable alternate site.
