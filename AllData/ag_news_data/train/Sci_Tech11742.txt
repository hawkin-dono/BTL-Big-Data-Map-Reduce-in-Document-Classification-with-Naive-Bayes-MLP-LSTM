iMac G5: Most Elegant Desktop Ever  #147;I am writing these words on the most elegant desktop computer I #146;ve ever used, #148; writes Walt Mossberg about the iMac G5 in the Wall Street Journal,  #147;a computer that is not only uncommonly beautiful but fast and powerful, virus-free and surprisingly affordable. This machine takes up no more space on a desk than a flat-panel monitor. In fact, the entire computer is contained behind a flat-panel screen in a space just 2 inches thick  #151; thinner than most flat-panel monitors alone. #148; Sep 23
