They're *sooooo* cute!\\I have some more:\\ - If you've ever traveled outside of the US you can't vote.\\ - If you have a graduate degree you can't vote.\\ - If you make less than 6 figures you can't vote\\ - If you can spell Nuclear and pronounce it correctly then you can't vote.\\ - If you haven't accept Jesus as savior then you can't vote.\\ - If you've never ordered anything from Bass Pro Shops then you can't vote.\\This is fun... if you can think of anymore please add a comment!\\
