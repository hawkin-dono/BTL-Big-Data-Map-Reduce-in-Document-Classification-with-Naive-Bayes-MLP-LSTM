Nokia's take on '20s glamour Nokia on Thursday announced three new camera phones that it says are inspired by the style of the 1920s. One model in particular is described by the Finnish phone giant as "Garbo-esque" in its design character (that would be the 7270). All three handsets are shown here in art released by the company.
