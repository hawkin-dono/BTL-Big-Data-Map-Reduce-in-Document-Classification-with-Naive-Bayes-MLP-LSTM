Chargers Go for Rare 10-Win Season (AP) AP - Although the resurgent San Diego Chargers can't clinch a playoff berth Sunday, they can continue to rehabilitate their image. Sad sacks just a year ago, the Chargers (9-3) have at least clinched a winning season. If they beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-7) at home, they'll have won 10 games for the first time since 1994, when they were 11-5 and made their only Super Bowl appearance.
