But seriously folks By now, it's clear that the parity in the NFL this season doesn't mean there are a lot of good teams, but rather a lot of bad ones. More teams have losing records, in fact, than winning ones. There are 14 teams at either 4-5 or 3-6, all of whom will tell you they are still in the playoff hunt.
