The Rundown 5 LSU at 14 Auburn  3:30 p.m., WUSA-9, WJZ-13 &lt;br&gt;Don't expect a resolution to LSU's quarterback controversy, which pits freshman JaMarcus Russell against senior Marcus Randall. "My view is that both quarterbacks can be weapons for our team," LSU Coach Nick Saban said. No such controversy in Auburn's backfield, where Carnell Williams and Ronnie Brown are both averaging more than 100 rushing yards per game. Hurricane Ivan, of course, is raging in the South. But so is Auburn, which remembers the 31-7 thrashing at the hands of LSU last season. The winner of this game will be the favorite in the SEC West.
