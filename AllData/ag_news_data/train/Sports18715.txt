Sluman Hits Course-Record 62 at Chrysler (AP) AP - Golf finally felt easy to Jeff Sluman, and it wasn't hard to see why. From a fairway bunker on the 18th hole, he had to play a 20-yard hook to avoid the trees and reach the elevated green. His 7-iron stopped 16 inches from the cup for his ninth birdie, a course-record 62 and a two-shot lead in the Chrysler Championship on Thursday.
