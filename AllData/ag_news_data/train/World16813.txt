Baghdad Needs 10,000 More Policemen - U.S. General  BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The U.S. general in charge of Baghdad  said Tuesday it would be at least another eight months before  the Iraqi capital had enough police, contradicting previous  U.S. claims that numbers were sufficient.  Maj. Gen. Pete Chiarelli, whose 1st Cavalry Division is  responsible for security in Baghdad and its suburbs -- an area  of about six million people -- said there were currently about  15,000 people working for the capital's force.
