Canadian ports are 'sieves' says Transport Minister Jean Lapierre (Canadian Press) Canadian Press - GATINEAU, Que. (CP) - Transport Minister Jean Lapierre described Canada's ports Friday as "sieves," adding the federal government must take measures to tighten security on the waterfront.  "It's clear that Canadian ports cannot remain sieves," he said during a speech to the Quebec Federation of Chambers of Commerce. "We have to tighten the screw." Asked later to clarify his comments, the minister said he was only quoting from a 2002 Senate report that criticized port security.
