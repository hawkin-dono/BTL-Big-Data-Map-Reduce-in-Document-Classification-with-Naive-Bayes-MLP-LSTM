Router Solutions, a three-person company in McLean, wants to help companies reduce the time their tech departments devote to such routine fixes. The company said it has developed a system-operation-management platform that monitors what's happening across an entire network, detecting issues when they arise and  fixing them with little or no intervention from network engineers.
