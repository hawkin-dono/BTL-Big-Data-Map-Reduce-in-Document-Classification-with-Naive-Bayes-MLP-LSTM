Area College Football Capsules Navy at Tulsa &lt;br&gt;   Where:  Skelly Stadium    When:  7 p.m. &lt;br&gt;   Shooting for 3-0:  Navy is off to its first 2-0 start since 1996. The Midshipmen haven't started 3-0 since 1979, when they won their first six games and finished 7-4. Navy has started 3-0 only twice in the past 40 years -- the 1978 team won its first seven games. Tulsa, which improved from 1-11 in 2002 to 8-5 last season, the best turnaround in college football, has lost its first two games, 21-3 at Kansas and 38-21 at Oklahoma State. Going 3-0 "would be a great start, and it would be a great beginning to achieve the goals that they've set for themselves," Navy Coach Paul Johnson said. "It's not going to make the season if we win, and it's not going to kill it if we lose."
