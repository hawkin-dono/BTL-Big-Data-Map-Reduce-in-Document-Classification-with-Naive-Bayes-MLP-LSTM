Justice -- Guantanamo Style The USA has been keeping approximately 600 detainees at Guantanamo Bay.  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has called them "the worst of the worst".  Other sources have described them otherwise.    Abdurahman Khadr, who the CIA placed, as a mole, within the detainee population, said most of the detainees were innocent, or were merely local Taliban militia-men, with no intelligence value.    Well, after no public review of their status, the Guantanamo detainees are finally getting   their day in court -- kind of.  There are actually three separate kinds of reviews slowly underway.
