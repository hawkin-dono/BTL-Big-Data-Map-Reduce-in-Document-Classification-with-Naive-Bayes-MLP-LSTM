Confusion Over Arafat, Palestinians Prepare Burial  PARIS (Reuters) - Palestinians looked to their leadership  to lift confusion over Yasser Arafat's fate in a Paris hospital  on Wednesday as preparations gathered pace to bury the icon of  their fight for statehood. Arafat, 75, suffered a brain  hemorrhage on Tuesday at the hospital where he was flown from  the West Bank on Oct. 29 and had lain in a coma. Officials  insisted in public that he was alive, though aides said  privately that he was dead.
