Cal Gets the Breaks to Hold Off Oregon (AP) AP - Geoff McArthur ignored his separated shoulder, reaching high above his head to snare California's go-ahead touchdown pass. A few anxious minutes later, Oregon's final throw ricocheted off Keith Allen's hands and dropped to the grass, ending the Ducks' upset bid. After 853 yards of offense, everything came down to two passes  #151; and the fourth-ranked Golden Bears caught the ball and the breaks.
