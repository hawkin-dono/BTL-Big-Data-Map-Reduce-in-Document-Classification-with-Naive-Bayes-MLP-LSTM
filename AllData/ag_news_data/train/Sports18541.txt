Zito taking shot at triple crowning Trainer Nick Zito has come to Lone Star Park with Birdstone, an outstanding 3-year-old who has a shot in Saturday's \$4 million Breeders' Cup Classic. It is less known that Zito also brought two good 2-year-olds, a colt, Sun King, and a filly, In The Gold, but they are legitimate contenders in the juvenile divisions.
