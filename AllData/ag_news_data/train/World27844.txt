Interpreter Says No To Secrecy Interpreters have long been the cogs in the wheel of international diplomacy. They make headlines only when they mess up, as when President Jimmy Carter's interpreter spoke of the Polish people's "lusts for the future" instead of their  "desires" for the future.  And even then, convention demands that interpreters  remain in the background, refraining from public comment.
