Tim's Cook-For-Yourself Diet Plan:  Save money and lose weight My weight has been up and down over the past several years.  I'd lose weight, but I'd have trouble keeping it off, and all the other problems that many people have.  Looking back on it, I find that one of my biggest problems is lack of discipline.  While I could keep myself under control for a while, that control would slip, and the weight would come back.    Over the past year, however, I have managed to find a diet plan which I have been successful with.  As with anything that works well, the progress has been slow, but it has been steady.  This diet plan is of my own devising, so your mileage may vary, but I think it's a lot of common sense that you've already heard anyway.
