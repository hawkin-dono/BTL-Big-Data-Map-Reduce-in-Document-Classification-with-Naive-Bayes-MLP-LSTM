Bad Sex For the past 12 years, the Literary Review has held an annual Bad Sex competition aimed at exposing "the crude, tasteless, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel, and to discourage it".   This year's winner, drawn from a shortlist that included Will Self, Andre Brink and Nadeem Aslam, was veteran journalist and author Tom Wolfe.
