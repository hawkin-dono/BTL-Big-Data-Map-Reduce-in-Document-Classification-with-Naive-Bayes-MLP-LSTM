Mindawn offers DRM-free music downloads (MacCentral) MacCentral - Mindawn is a new online music download service that differs from Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes Music Store and other services in a few ways: It's not only compatible with Macs and PCs but with Linux computers too, its music is available in a lossless format, and there are no Digital Rights Management (DRM) restrictions. Mindawn launched in September and is picking up steam, according to its founder.
