Belmont beats the best to take its place at the top Any time in the last decade and a half, yesterday's result would have been an upset. With a 3-2 victory over host Winchester, the Belmont girls' soccer team took the Middlesex League title from the Sachems for the first time in 16 years, and avenged a 1-1 tie with Winchester that was the only blemish on a 15-0-1 season.
