NAIA Coach Nears Matching Smith's Total (AP) AP - Harry Statham thought he was making a temporary stop when he took over as McKendree College's basketball coach in 1966.

Statham figured if he could put a few successful seasons together at McKendree, his alma mater, he'd be able to land a better job.
