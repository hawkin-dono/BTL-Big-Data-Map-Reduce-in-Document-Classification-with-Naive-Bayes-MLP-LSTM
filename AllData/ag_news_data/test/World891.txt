Taiwan's Leader Urges China to Begin Talks (AP) AP - Taiwan's leader used his National Day speech Sunday to urge China to begin peace talks so the two rivals can avoid war. Chinese and Taiwanese leaders haven't met since the Communists took over China in 1949 and Taiwan began resisting the mainland's rule. China insists that Taiwan is a Chinese province and has threatened to attack if it refuses to unify eventually.
